# Welcome to My FIRST blog!
I don't have much experience creating websites, but when I saw NetworkChuck's [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXfFBEuCAr0&pp=ygUVbmV0d29yayBjaHVjayB3ZWJzaXRl) I was inspired to create my own. This is the story of how I did it.

# Well its just a website, how difficult can that be? 
It depends.. I went into it not knowing anything, except the fact I wanted a blog and some information about myself.
With what I learned from Chuck, I wanted GitHub to host my site, since it's easy to host and **free**. GitHub has a feature called [GitHub Skills](https://github.com/skills) which is a guide to learn how to use github. One of the skills is [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/skills/github-pages) and how to "*Create a site or blog from your GitHub repositories with GitHub Pages.*"  

After following the tutorial, I had a basic idea of how to create a blog using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) that was integrated with GitHub Pages and use markdown, a simple language GitHub is known for. My site looked horrendous and I didn't like it, so I switched HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) as I am more familiar with HTML.
Just using HTML doesn't make for the prettiest websites, check out [toad.com](http://www.toad.com/). I was stumped, maybe it wasn't just *easy* to create a website, it might take some time?

# A different approach!
The idea of designing a website from scratch and doing everything myself quickly became something I didn’t want to do. However, I realized that if I could come up with a clear idea of how the site should look, maybe I could create something interesting.
Deviant Ollam has been a big inspiration for some of my projects and ideas. He introduced me to physical pentesting, RFID hacking, and lock bypassing. His [website](deviating.net) has a simple, clean design with a dark theme that feels mysterious and focused. I was drawn to how straightforward it is — no extra clutter or distractions, just the important stuff. The black background with white and red text gives it a cool vibe and makes everything easy to read.

What I really like about his site is how it centers around key information and important links. The layout uses bold icons and simple text, which gives it a clear and direct look. Each icon is unique and links to different content or profiles, adding a personal touch while keeping the style consistent.

When I started designing my website, I wanted to incorporate the best parts of his site but with my own twist. Here’s what I imagined:
- Links to my Instagram, GitHub, YouTube, Discord and Blogpost
- A blogpost that's easy to manage and add posts to
- A simple design
- Something cool

In adobe XD I designed a *rough mockup* for my site. It was just some text and some boxes for links

I put the image in to ChatGPT-4o, asked it to remake it in HTML with a simple, green "hacking inspired" look. The result was a good start, with some minor tweaks I had a website. 
DALL-E made me an icon in the inspired style, so I had a website.
